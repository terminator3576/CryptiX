# CryptiX
python hashing software


**Use**

1) Enter an input in input.txt
   
3) Enter a security level, this will shuffle the bits more thouroughly the higher the number, reducing the probablility of collisions and apparent randomness, but is a tradeoff between time and security.
   
4) Now the algorithm calculates the hash by first of all shuffling the bits, then padding/shortening the output. Last of all, it uses a variation of the Merkleâ€“Hellman cryptosystem to produce a strong hash. 

5) Finally, you get your output which, without a computer, would take days to calculate. You however don't care and having entered an excessively large security level are wondering why it took so long :)
